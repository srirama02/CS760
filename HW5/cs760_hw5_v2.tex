\section{Clustering}

\subsection{K-means Clustering (14 points)}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{(6 Points)}
Given $n$ observations $X_1^n = \{X_1, \dots, X_n\}$, $X_i \in \Xcal$, the K-means objective
is to find $k$
($<n$) centres $\mu_1^k = \{\mu_1, \dots, \mu_k\}$, and a rule $f:\Xcal \rightarrow
\{1,\dots, K\}$ so as to minimize the objective

\begin{equation}
J(\mu_1^K, f; X_1^n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^K \indfone(f(X_i) = k) \|X_i - \mu_k\|^2
\label{eqn:kmeans}
\end{equation}

Let $\Jcal_K(X_1^n) = \min_{\mu_1^K, f} J(\mu_1^K, f; X_1^n)$. Prove that
$\Jcal_{K}(X_1^n)$ is a non-increasing function of $K$.

\begin{soln}
  Let \( \Jcal_K(X_1^n) \) be the minimum value of the K-means objective function for a fixed \( K \), given by:
  \begin{equation}
      \Jcal_K(X_1^n) = \min_{\mu_1^K, f} J(\mu_1^K, f; X_1^n).
  \end{equation}

  We need to show that for any \( K \) and \( K+1 \) such that \( K < K+1 < n \), the following holds:
  \begin{equation}
      \Jcal_{K+1}(X_1^n) \leq \Jcal_K(X_1^n).
  \end{equation}

  Assume we have the optimal set of centers \( \mu_1^K \) and the optimal assignment rule \( f \) for \( K \) clusters that achieves the minimum \( \Jcal_K(X_1^n) \). Now consider adding one more center to form \( K+1 \) clusters. Place the new center \( \mu_{K+1} \) at the position of any existing center or at a new position, and define a new assignment rule \( f' \) which behaves exactly like \( f \) for the first \( K \) centers and does not initially assign any point to the new center \( \mu_{K+1} \). Therefore, initially we have:
  \begin{equation}
      J(\mu_1^{K+1}, f'; X_1^n) = J(\mu_1^K, f; X_1^n).
  \end{equation}

  Since \( \Jcal_{K+1}(X_1^n) \) is the minimum for \( K+1 \) centers, by definition, it cannot be greater than any other value of the objective function with \( K+1 \) centers. Thus, we have:
  \begin{equation}
      \Jcal_{K+1}(X_1^n) \leq J(\mu_1^{K+1}, f'; X_1^n).
  \end{equation}

  Combining the last two equations, we get:
  \begin{equation}
      \Jcal_{K+1}(X_1^n) \leq J(\mu_1^K, f; X_1^n) = \Jcal_K(X_1^n).
  \end{equation}

  This proves that \( \Jcal_{K}(X_1^n) \) is a non-increasing function of \( K \).

\end{soln}

\item \textbf{(8 Points)}
Consider the K-means (Lloyd's) clustering algorithm we studied in class. We
terminate the algorithm when there are no changes to the objective.
Show that the algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps.
\begin{soln}
  We consider the standard K-means clustering algorithm. The algorithm proceeds iteratively as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Initialize \( K \) cluster centers \( \mu_1^K \) in the data space.
      \item \textbf{Assignment step:} Assign each data point \( X_i \) to the nearest cluster center \( \mu_k \).
      \item \textbf{Update step:} Recompute the cluster centers as the mean of all points assigned to them.
      \item Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the assignment of data points to centers does not change.
  \end{enumerate}

  To prove that the algorithm terminates in a finite number of steps, consider the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
      \item The K-means algorithm partitions the data space into a finite number of regions, each corresponding to a Voronoi cell defined by the closest cluster center.
      \item In each iteration, data points are assigned to the nearest cluster center. This assignment is deterministic given the current cluster centers.
      \item When the cluster centers are updated, they are computed as the centroid of the data points assigned to them. This results in the center moving inside the convex hull of the assigned data points, which is a finite space.
      \item If there are no changes to the objective, it implies that the assignment of data points to the cluster centers remains the same. Given that the data set is finite, there are only a finite number of possible assignments.
      \item Therefore, the algorithm must converge in a finite number of steps because there are only a finite number of ways to partition a finite data set into \( K \) clusters.
      \item Furthermore, each iteration strictly decreases the objective function \( J \) (unless it has reached convergence), which is the sum of squared distances from each data point to its assigned cluster center.
      \item Since the objective function \( J \) is bounded below by zero and strictly decreases with each iteration (except at termination), and there are only a finite number of different partitionings of the data set, the algorithm cannot cycle indefinitely and must terminate.
  \end{enumerate}

  Thus, the K-means algorithm will terminate in a finite number of steps.

\end{soln}



\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Experiment (20 Points)}

In this question, we will evaluate
K-means clustering and GMM on a simple 2 dimensional problem.
First, create a two-dimensional synthetic dataset of 300 points by sampling 100 points each from the
three Gaussian distributions shown below:
\[
P_a = \Ncal\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix},
\;
\sigma\begin{bmatrix}
2, &0.5 \\ 0.5, &1
\end{bmatrix}
\right),
\quad
P_b = \Ncal\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ -1
\end{bmatrix},
\;
 \sigma\begin{bmatrix}
1, &-0.5 \\ -0.5, &2
\end{bmatrix}
\right),
\quad
P_c = \Ncal\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix},
\;
 \sigma\begin{bmatrix}
1 &0 \\ 0, &2
\end{bmatrix}
\right)
\]
Here, $\sigma$ is a parameter we will change to produce different datasets.\\

First implement K-means clustering and the expectation maximization algorithm for GMMs.
Execute both methods on five synthetic datasets,
generated as shown above with $\sigma \in \{0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8\}$. Finally, evaluate both methods on \emph{(i)} the clustering objective~\eqref{eqn:kmeans} and \emph{(ii)}  the clustering accuracy. For each of the two criteria, plot the value achieved by each method against $\sigma$.\\


Guidelines:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Both algorithms are only guaranteed to find only a local optimum so we recommend trying multiple
restarts and picking the one with the lowest objective value (This is~\eqref{eqn:kmeans} for K-means and the negative log likelihood for GMMs).
You may also experiment with a smart initialization
strategy (such as kmeans++).

\item
To plot the clustering accuracy,  you may treat the `label' of points generated from distribution
$P_u$ as $u$, where $u\in \{a, b, c\}$.
Assume that the cluster id $i$ returned by a method is $i\in \{1, 2, 3\}$.
Since clustering is an unsupervised learning problem, you should obtain the best possible mapping
from $\{1, 2, 3\}$ to $\{a, b, c\}$ to compute the clustering objective.
One way to do this is to compare the clustering centers returned by the method (centroids for
K-means, means for GMMs) and map them to the distribution with the closest mean.

\end{itemize}

Points break down: 7 points each for implementation of each method, 6 points for reporting of
evaluation metrics.


\section{Linear Dimensionality Reduction}

\subsection{Principal Components Analysis  (10 points)}
\label{sec:pca}

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a popular method for linear dimensionality reduction. PCA attempts to find a lower dimensional subspace such that when you project the data onto the subspace as much of the information is preserved. Say we have data $X = [x_1^\top; \dots; x_n^\top] \in \RR^{n\times D}$ where  $x_i \in \RR^D$. We wish to find a $d$ ($ < D$) dimensional subspace $A = [a_1, \dots, a_d] \in \RR^{D\times d}$, such that $ a_i \in \RR^D$ and $A^\top A = I_d$, so as to maximize $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \|A^\top x_i\|^2$.
\begin{enumerate}

\item  \textbf{(4 Points)}
Suppose we wish to find the first direction $a_1$ (such that $a_1^\top a_1 = 1$) to maximize $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i (a_1^\top x_i)^2$.
Show that $a_1$ is the first right singular vector of $X$.

\item  \textbf{(6 Points)}
Given $a_1, \dots, a_k$, let $A_k = [a_1, \dots, a_k]$ and 
$\tilde{x}_i = x_i - A_kA_k^\top x_i$. We wish to find $a_{k+1}$, to maximize
$\frac{1}{n} \sum_i (a_{k+1}^\top \tilde{x}_i)^2$. Show that $a_{k+1}$ is the
$(k+1)^{th}$ right singular vector of $X$.


\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Dimensionality reduction via optimization (22 points)}

We will now motivate the dimensionality reduction problem from a slightly different
perspective. The resulting algorithm has many similarities to PCA.
We will refer to method as DRO.

As before, you are given data $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x_i \in \RR^D$. Let $X=[x_1^\top; \dots
x_n^\top] \in \RR^{n\times D}$. We suspect that the data
actually lies approximately in  a $d$ dimensional affine subspace.
Here $d<D$ and $d<n$.
Our goal, as in PCA, is to use this dataset to find a $d$ dimensional representation $z$ for each $x\in\RR^D$.
(We will assume that the span of the data has dimension larger than
$d$, but our method should work whether $n>D$ or $n<D$.)


Let $z_i\in \RR^d$ be the lower dimensional representation for $x_i$ and
let $Z = [z_1^\top; \dots; z_n^\top] \in \RR^{n\times d}$.
We wish to find parameters $A \in \RR^{D\times d}$, $b\in\RR^D$ and the lower
dimensional representation $Z\in \RR^{n\times d}$ so as to minimize 
\begin{equation}
J(A,b,Z) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \|x_i - Az_i - b\|^2 = \| X - ZA^\top - \one b^\top\|_F^2.
\label{eqn:dimobj}
\end{equation}
Here, $\|A\|^2_F = \sum_{i,j} A_{ij}^2$ is the Frobenius norm of a matrix.


\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{(3 Points)}
Let $M\in\RR^{d\times d}$ be an arbitrary invertible matrix and $p\in\RR^{d}$ be an arbitrary vector.
Denote, $A_2 = A_1M^{-1}$, $b_2 = b_1- A_1M^{-1}p$ and $Z_2 = Z_1 M^\top +
\one p^\top$.
Show that both
$(A_1, b_1, Z_1)$ and $(A_2, b_2, Z_2)$ achieve the same objective value $J$~\eqref{eqn:dimobj}.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, in order to make the problem determined, we need to impose some
constraint on $Z$. We will assume that the $z_i$'s have zero mean and identity covariance.
That is,
\begin{align*}
\Zbar = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n z_i =\frac{1}{n} Z^\top {\bf 1}_n = 0, \hspace{0.3in} 
S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n z_i z_i^\top 
= \frac{1}{n} Z^\top Z
= I_d
\end{align*}
Here, ${\bf 1}_d = [1, 1 \dots, 1]^\top \in\RR^d$ and $I_d$  is the $d\times d$ identity matrix.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item \textbf{(16 Points)}
Outline a procedure to solve the above problem. Specify how you
would obtain $A, Z, b$ which minimize the objective and satisfy the constraints.

\textbf{Hint: }The rank $k$ approximation of a matrix in Frobenius norm is obtained by
taking its SVD and then zeroing out all but the first $k$ singular values.

\item \textbf{(3 Points)}
You are given a point $x_*$ in the original $D$ dimensional space.
State the rule to obtain the $d$ dimensional
representation $z_*$ for this new point.
(If $x_*$ is some original point $x_i$ from the $D$--dimensional space, it shoud be the
$d$--dimensional representation $z_i$.)


\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Experiment (34 points)}

Here we will compare the above three methods on two data sets. 

\begin{itemize}
\item We will implement three variants of PCA:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item "buggy PCA": PCA applied directly on the matrix $X$.
    \item "demeaned PCA": We subtract the mean along each dimension before applying PCA.
    \item "normalized PCA": Before applying PCA, we subtract the mean and scale each dimension so that the sample  mean and standard deviation along each dimension is $0$ and $1$ respectively.
    
\end{enumerate}



\item 
One way to study how well the low dimensional representation $Z$ captures the linear
structure in our data is to project $Z$ back to $D$ dimensions and look at the reconstruction
error. For PCA, if we mapped it to $d$ dimensions via $z = Vx$ then the
reconstruction is $V^\top z$. For the preprocessed versions, we first do this and then
reverse the preprocessing steps as well. For DRO  we just compute $Az + b$.
We will compare all methods by the reconstruction error on the datasets.

\item 
Please implement code for the methods: Buggy PCA (just take the SVD of $X$)
, Demeaned PCA,
Normalized PCA, DRO. In all cases your function should take in
an $n \times d$ data matrix and $d$ as an argument. It should return the
the $d$ dimensional representations, the estimated parameters, and the
reconstructions of these representations in $D$ dimensions. 

\item
You are given two datasets: A two Dimensional dataset with $50$ points 
\texttt{data2D.csv} and a thousand dimensional dataset with $500$ points
\texttt{data1000D.csv}. 

\item
For the $2D$ dataset use $d=1$. For the $1000D$ dataset, you need to choose
$d$. For this, observe the singular values in DRO and see if there is a clear
``knee point" in the spectrum.
Attach any figures/ Statistics you computed to justify your choice.

\item
For the $2D$ dataset you need to attach the a 
plot comparing the orignal points with the reconstructed points for all 4
methods.
For both datasets you should also report the reconstruction errors, that is the squared sum of
differences $\sum_{i=1}^n \|x_i - r(z_i)\|^2$,
where $x_i$'s are the original points and $r(z_i)$ are the $D$ dimensional points
reconstructed from the 
$d$ dimensional representation $z_i$.

\item \textbf{Questions:} After you have completed the experiments, please answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at the results for Buggy PCA. The reconstruction error is bad and the
reconstructed points don't seem to well represent the original points. Why is
this? \\
\textbf{Hint: } Which subspace is Buggy PCA trying to project the points
onto?
\item The error criterion we are using is the average squared error 
between the original points and the reconstructed points.
In both examples DRO and demeaned PCA achieves the lowest error among all
methods. 
Is this surprising? Why?
\end{enumerate}

\item Point allocation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Implementation of the three PCA methods: \textbf{(6 Points)}
\item Implementation of DRO: \textbf{(6 points)}
\item Plots showing original points and reconstructed points for 2D dataset for each one of the 4 methods: \textbf{(10 points)}
\item Implementing reconstructions and reporting results for each one of the 4 methods for the 2 datasets: \textbf{(5 points)}
\item Choice of $d$ for $1000D$ dataset and appropriate justification:
\textbf{(3 Points)}
\item Questions \textbf{(4 Points)}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Answer format:}  \\
The graph bellow is in example of how a plot of one of the algorithms for the 2D dataset may look like: \\
